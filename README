The Patch Review plugin allows easy single or multipatch code or diff reviews.

It opens each affected (modified/added/deleted) file in the patch or in a version controlled workspace diff in a diff view in a separate tab.

VIM provides the :diffpatch command to do single file reviews but can not handle patch files containing multiple patches as is common with software development projects.  This plugin provides that missing functionality.

It also does not pollute the workspace like :diffpatch does by writing files in the workspace.

It does automatic diff generation for various version control systems by running their respective diff commands.
