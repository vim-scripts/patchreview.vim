The Patch Review plugin allows single or multipatch code or diff reviews to be done in VIM.

It opens each affected file in the patch or workspace diff in a diff view in a separate Tab.

VIM provides the :diffpatch command to do single file reviews but can not handle patch files containing multiple patches as is common with software development projects.  This plugin provides that missing functionality. 

It also improves on :diffpatch's behaviour of creating the patched files in the same directory as original file which leads to project workspace pollution.
